So I tried: `sudo chown -R neo4j:neo4j /var/lib/neo4j/data` and the problem went away. Apparently when I&#39;d done a restore of the database I&#39;d run the neo4j server as root and when the system runs neo4j it does it as the user neo4j so couldn&#39;t read any of its data.  It seems that an error like this would warrant an easy to parse error message but verbosity is not the neo4j way.",

`Database &#39;neo4j&#39; is unavailable. Run :sysinfo for more info.`

I have tried uninstalling neo4j and reinstalling but that has not worked either. I tried playing around with the default listen address previously, but now with the reinstall all config data is back to normal. Running ./neo4j-community-4.1.1/bin/cypher-shell under bin does not work. It says:

`Unable to establish connection in 3000ms`

If I run ./neo4j-community-4.1.1/bin/cypher-shell -a 192.168.0.19 it says:

`Database &#39;neo4j&#39; is unavailable`

When I run ./neo4j-community-4.1.1/bin/neo4j-admin check-consistency --database=neo4j it also states:

`.2020-08-18 22:12:16.868+0000 WARN [o.n.c.ConsistencyCheckService] Index was dirty on startup which means it was not shutdown correctly and need to be cleaned up with a successful recovery.

I would love to reset everything from scratch but I am unsure how
At this point I cannot even access the browser at localhost:7474. It hangs indefinitely trying to load.

I am truly stumped. Anyone have any advice on how I navigate this issue?

        "body_markdown": "I&#39;m trying to implement encrypt with AES/128/CBC, but I need to encrypt with a 64 bytes key, But I have the problem with the length.

It is possible encrypt AES/128/CBC with a 64 bytes key or not, because I have the cipher algoritm in php with a 64 bytes key and it works, but not in java.

This is the encrypt code:

    
	 public static String ALGORITHM = &quot;AES&quot;;
	
	 public static String AES_CBC_PADDING = &quot;AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding&quot;;

	 public static byte[] encrypt(final byte[] key, final byte[] IV, final byte[] message) throws Exception {
	  return AESManager.encryptDecrypt(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, IV, message);
	 }

	 public static byte[] decrypt(final byte[] key, final byte[] IV, final byte[] message) throws Exception {
	  return AESManager.encryptDecrypt(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key, IV, message);
	 }

	 private static byte[] encryptDecrypt(final int mode, final byte[] key, 
			 							final byte[] IV, final byte[] message) throws Exception {
	  final Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(AES_CBC_PADDING);
	  final SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, ALGORITHM);
	  final IvParameterSpec ivSpec = new IvParameterSpec(IV);
	  cipher.init(mode, keySpec, ivSpec);
	  return cipher.doFinal(message);
	 }

	 public static String getHex(byte[] data, int length) {
	  StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
	  for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
	   String hexStr = Integer.toHexString(((int) data[i]) &amp; 0xFF);
	   if (hexStr.length() &lt; 2) {
	    sb.append(&quot;0&quot;).append(hexStr.toUpperCase());
	   } else {
	    sb.append(hexStr.toUpperCase());
	   }
	  }
	  return sb.toString();
	 }

I have this error:

    java.security.InvalidKeyException: Invalid AES key length: 64 bytes

I have local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_241\jre\lib\security
so, what could be the problem ?

        "body_markdown": "As stated by @dnault the en-/decryption key for AES-128 is 16 bytes long (AES-192 = 24 bytes, AES-256 = 32 bytes). You wrote that you are presenting a 64 character long key to the decryption method in PHP. My sample program shows that only the first 16 characters of the key were used.

**Solution for your Java-app:** just use the first (seen from the left side) 16 bytes of your &quot;key&quot; for encryption and decryption:

        $key = &quot;1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234&quot;;
        var_dump($key);
        $iv =  &quot;\x08\x07\x05\x06\x04\x01\x02\x03\x12\x11\x0f\x10\x0e\x0b\x0c\x0d&quot;;
        $encrypted = base64_encode(openssl_encrypt($plaintext, $method, $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv));
        echo &#39;encrypted with key &#39; . $key . &#39; is &#39; . $encrypted . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;. PHP_EOL;
        // truncated key = first 16 characters as for aes-128-cbc
        $key = &quot;1234567890123456&quot;;
        var_dump($key);
        $encrypted = base64_encode(openssl_encrypt($plaintext, $method, $key, OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, $iv));
        echo &#39;encrypted with key &#39; . $key . &#39; is &#39; . $encrypted . &#39;&lt;br&gt;&#39;. PHP_EOL;
    ?&gt;

Result:
